<p style="text-align:justify; padding-right:25%;padding-left: 25%; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Stanisław Kostka S.J.</b> (28 October 1550 – 15 August 1568) was a Polish novice of the Society of Jesus. He is venerated in the Catholic Church as <b>Saint Stanislaus Kostka</b> (as distinct from his namesake, the 11th-century Bishop of Kraków Stanislaus the Martyr).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;padding-right:25%;padding-left: 25%;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was born at Rostkowo, Przasnysz County, Poland, on 28 October 1550; died at Rome during the night of 14–15 August 1568. He entered the Society of Jesus in Rome on his 17th birthday (28 October 1567), and is said to have foretold his death a few days before it occurred.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;padding-right:25%;padding-left: 25%;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy See ratified his beatification in 1605; he was canonized in 1726. <b>St. Stanislaus</b> is a popular saint of Poland and many religious institutions have chosen him as the protector of their novitiates. The representations of him in art are very varied; he is sometimes depicted receiving Holy Communion from the hands of angels; sometimes receiving the Infant Jesus from the hands of the Virgin; or he is shown in the midst of a battle putting to flight the enemies of his country. At times he is depicted near a fountain putting a wet linen cloth on his breast. He is invoked for palpitations of the heart and for dangerous cases of illness (Cahier, “Caractéristiques des Saints”). <b> Stanislaus’ </b> is November 13th.</p>
